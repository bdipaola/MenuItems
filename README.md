<p>This project was done as an introduction to NP-Complete problems as well as the Paperclip plugin.</p>

<p>In order for file uploads to work appropriately, ImageMagicK must be installed. See Paperclip documentation here: https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip</p>

<p>Note regarding NP-Complete/Subset Sum calculation</p>
The project assumes that the subset sum will be for positive values. Ideally, this application may be used for calculating money combinations.<br>
The subset sum calculations were guided by the work and explanation provided by Alan Skorkin (see: http://www.skorks.com/2011/02/algorithms-a-dropbox-challenge-and-dynamic-programming/)
